      <p>The data set was taken from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783"> DataSF Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present</a>. The data was exported from the
        website on 4/11/2020, to be investigated further.
        The dataset was taken again on 4/26/2020.
      The data set has 337K Rows and 26 columns. Each row is an Incident Record. The data gets published daily, and changes hourly. <br>
      To better understand the incident codes, this  <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/widgets/ci9u-8awy">Reference site</a> was used.</p>

      <h3>About the data</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          This dataset includes police incident reports filed by officers and by individuals through self-service online reporting for non-emergency cases. Reports included are
          those for incidents that occurred starting January 1, 2018 onward and have been approved by a supervising officer.
          Disclaimer: The San Francisco Police Department does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or correct
          sequencing of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.

          <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>

          <p>So far, no clear wrangling has been done other than exporting the data from DataSF, mainly because I'm still settling on
            a a particular view and subset of the data.</p>
            <h4>Update</h4>
            <p>Further wrangling was done to take the data starting from March 16 to April 27th of 2019 and 2020.</p>
