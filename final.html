            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>I was told I was using too many colors and that the visualization was crowded, the interactivity helped fix that.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>About the Visualization</h2>
            <p>The visualization shows a comparison between March 15 and May 10 for some Incident Subcategories, I chose to use only a few
            subcategories for two reasons, the first is speed of loading data to the page, the second to illustrate which type of calls had
            been reduced and which ones were on the rise. </p>

            <h2>Encoding</h2>

            <h3>Map</h3>
            <p>The encoding on the map is simple, it's a general map of San Francisco, I did not include streets as they are not necessay and take a considerable time to load.
            Within the map circles appear where the incidient was reported, as either green or purple circles representing the year 2019 and 2020 respectively.  </p>

            <h3>Diverging Bar Chart</h3>
            <p>For the bar chart, the numbers on the x-axis are meant to be percentages, to the right an increase of Incidents in this subcategory for 2020 with
            respect to 2019, to the left an decrease of the Incident Subcategory. The name of each subcategory is above the bar theat represents it.</p>

            <h2>Interactivity</h2>
            <p>For the interactivity, when clicking on any of the bars, its information shows up on the map, if the bar is clicked again the information disappears.
            A user can accumulate different bars.<br>
            There is also a tool tip that appears when the mouse hovers over a circle, giving information about the Neighborhood it's located in, the year it represents and
            the incident subcategory it represents.</p>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>In my narrative I was curious to see why so many sirens were going off near my apartment, I live near a police department and figured they were police sirens,
            looking at the data I can see that they are more likely to be fire department sirens, as there has been a significant increase in Arson cases and fire reports.
            Some outside fires are considered arson, however it could be interesting to see if arson is being commited as part of insurance fraud.<br>
            There has also been  an increase in attempted car theft and in car jacking.<br>
            An interesting find was that reesidential burglaries have gone down significantly since everyone has been staying home and commercial burglaries have been on the rise since
            many commercial locations are currently empty. <br>
            Larceny in general has gone down, larceny from vehicles has gone down significantly since the most common places to get your car broken into were downtown SOMA area and the
            tourist areas, such as the piers, since many people are not commuting downtown to work, or being tourists lately, these have gone down.
            <br>
            Finally calls that require people to stand close to you, such as pickpocketing, are very low, since we are practicing social distancing.
